we explain our framework and experimentation to exchange user's environmental information described in the form of cc/pp and rdf via http extension framework. in the next decade  most appliances will have micro web browser and server. these appliances collect and exchange the various kind of information  e.g.  location  temperature  existing among them. we investigated a new way for describing such kind of information using the framework of cc/pp. we have applied http extension framework to exchange their information. this combination will allow us to make web appliances useful without special extension of web. we have developed two browsers  extended one existing server to ensure the interoperability  and demonstrated effectiveness of our framework. finally  we present evaluation of our empirical study.

1. introduction 
use of user's environmental information in web environment has been raised as important issue  for web servers can customize their services by using them. we can use flyweight computers  move with them anytime and anywhere. these computers can always collect this information. we can get most desirable service by transfer this information.
