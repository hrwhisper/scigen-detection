it is becoming increasingly common to construct databases from information automatically culled from many heterogeneous sources. for example  a research publication database can be constructed by automatically extracting titles  authors  and conference information from online papers. a common difficulty in consolidating data from multiple sources is that records are referenced in a variety of ways  e.g. abbreviations  aliases  and misspellings . therefore  it can be difficult to construct a single  standard representation to present to the user. we refer to the task of constructing this representation as canonicalization. despite its importance  there is little existing work on canonicalization.
