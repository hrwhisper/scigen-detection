with the rapid growth of wireless technologies and mobile devices  there is a great demand for personalized services in mcommerce. collaborative filtering  cf  is one of successful techniques to produce personalized recommendations for users.  this paper proposes a novel approach to improve cf algorithms  where the contextual information of a user and the multicriteria ratings of an item are considered besides the typical information on users and items. the multilinear singular value decomposition  msvd  technique is utilized to explore both explicit relations and implicit relations among user  item and criterion. we implement the approach in an existing m-commerce platform  and encouraging experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
