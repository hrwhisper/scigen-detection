the kleinberg hits and the google pagerank algorithms are eigenvector methods for identifying  authoritative  or  influential  articles  given hyperlink or citation information. that such algorithms should give reliable or consistent answers is surely a desideratum  and in   we analyzed when they can be expected to give stable rankings under small perturbations to the linkage patterns. in this paper  we extend the analysis and show how it gives insight into ways of designing stable link analysis methods. this in turn motivates two new algorithms  whose performance we study empirically using citation data and web hyperlink data.
1.	introduction
¡¡from its origins in bibliometric analysis   the analysis of cross-referencing patterns- link analysis -has come to play an important role in modern information retrieval. link analysis algorithms have been successfully applied to web hyperlink data to identify authoritative information sources  and to academic citation data to identify influential papers  1  1 . in particular  together with classical ir ranking techniques  link analysis provides the basis for some of today's internet search engines.
