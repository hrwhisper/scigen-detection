to facilitate queries over semi-structured data  various structural summaries have been proposed. structural summaries are derived directly from the data and serve as indices for evaluating path expressions on semi-structured or xml data. we introduce the d k  index  an adaptive structural summary for general graph structured documents. building on previous work  1-index and a k  index  the d k -index is also based on the concept of bisimilarity. however  as a generalization of the 1-index and a k -index  the d k  index possesses the adaptive ability to adjust its structure according to the current query load. this dynamism also facilitates efficient update algorithms  which are crucial to practical applications of structural indices  but have not been adequately addressed in previous index proposals. our experiments show that the d k  index is a more effective structural summary than previous static ones  as a result of its query load sensitivity. in addition  update operations on the d k  index can be performed more efficiently than on its predecessors.
